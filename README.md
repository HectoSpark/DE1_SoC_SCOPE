*DE1_SOC_SCOPE*

The group consisted of Alexander Bolton, and Haider Shafiq. The project chosen
was to design and develop a multi-channel oscilloscope on the DE1-SoC. The aim of this
project was to take multiple input signals from a signal generator, and display them
accurately on a separate monitor, via the VGA port of the DE1-SoC.
